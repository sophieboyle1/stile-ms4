# Project Summary

Welcome to my Full Stack Frameworks with Django Project for Code Institute.

The goal of this project was to allow the user to create an account and make a purchase of products with Stripe. Although the majority of the admin activities is done through the Django admin site, the web app also provides more pleasant environment for common tasks such as adding, editing and deleting products or blog posts through the web app's UI.
I chose to develop an ecommerce shopping website as it is a complex and flexible application which challenged my understanding of the technologies involved. Given the sensitivity involved in handling customer details 
I had to approach development from a security conscious perspective.
