# Project Summary

Welcome to my Full Stack Frameworks with Django Project for Code Institute.

The goal of this project was to allow the user to create an account and make a purchase of products with Stripe. Although the majority of the admin activities is done through the Django admin site, the web app also provides more pleasant environment for common tasks such as adding, editing and deleting products or blog posts through the web app's UI.
I chose to develop an ecommerce shopping website as it is a complex and flexible application which challenged my understanding of the technologies involved. Given the sensitivity involved in handling customer details 
I had to approach development from a security conscious perspective.

# User Experience Design

## The Strategy Plane

Stile Homeware is a web-shop that represents a stored located in Dublin, Ireland. The customer can successfully purchase items and have them delivered to their home. For more user interaction, I created a blog with a comment section, and also a review option for all the products that is only available to logged in users.

## User Stories

As an e-commerce site owner...

* I want to offer a shopping journey that is informative and transparent so that the customers develop trust towards the marketplace.
* I want to have a marketplace offering more than just products so that the customers will have more reasons to come back to the site.
* I want to be able to make changes on the inventory myself so that I don't have to rely on external support when it comes to that.
* I want to be able to add, edit and adjust blog posts as I wish to do so.
* I want to offer a shopping journey that is informative and easy to navigate through.

As a customer...

* I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is intended for upon entering.
* I want to easily navigate the site so that I can find content quickly with ease on any device.
* I want to view a list of products or look for an individual item by its category.
* I want to view individual product details and view the shipping and return policy.
* I want to easily view the total of my purchases at any time and have the option to update or delete.
* I want to successfully register for an account and proceed to log in.
* I want to easily access my previous orders.
* I want to be able to store my shipping details so that it’s easier for me to check out.
* I want to be able to contact the store of the website incase I have any issues or questons.
* I want to be able to easily recover my password incase I forget it.

## The Scope Plane 

In designing the page, I wanted for the user to have a positive experience and for the web-site to be simple to use. User can navigate through navigation bar that is always visible and by links in the footer. They can go from any part of the web-site to any other part. Simple to navigate and intuitive.

### Features planned:

* Responsive Design - Site should function on mobile, tablet and desktop/laptop devices.
* Mobile and desktop navigations.
* Website information clearly relayed upon entering the home page.
* Standard e-commerce feed of products with the option to sort products and filter them by category name. 
* Every product can be added to the cart immediately and links to a product page where the user can read more about it.
* About page to inform the user a information about the owners, with a testimonials section.
* Blog page containing blog posts all bout DIY projects to give the user inspiration for their own home.
* Contact information and form to easily contact the store.
* Options for the customers to leave a review on a product.
